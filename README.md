# Go-210

A series of Go packages meant to provide implementations for many of Carnegie
Mellon 15-210's interfaces, including sequences, binary search trees, sets, and 
tables.

## Introduction

15-210, or Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms, is a computer
science course at Carnegie Mellon meant to teach students about classic
algorithms from a parallel perspective. That being said, the class is taught
(almost entirely) in SML, which (as nice and elegant as SML is), isn't exactly
the paradigm of parallelism.

Because A) Go has excellent, lightweight support for concurrency and B) I want
to learn more Go, I am writing implementations for the 15-210 library.
